# Equal-Area Cartogram of Brazil

⚠️ This repository is a work in progress ⚠️

Generate a map of Brazil where all states have the same area – which helps people perceive choropletic maps (maps with colored states) more precisely.

Add your own data (a numberical value for each state), change the color palette, and download the map as an editable SVG file.

This browser-based tool is intended for data journalists, designers and data visualization practitioners.
